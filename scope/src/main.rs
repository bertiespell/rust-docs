    // println!("{}", s1); // this line wouldn't work. If s1 and s2 both go out of scope there is a double-free error
    // to avoid this, Rust considers s1 to no longer be valid here

    // this doesn't just copy the pointer, length and capacity (which is a shallow copy) - it also invalidates the first variable and for this reason it is called a MOVE!
    // s1 was moved into s2

    // automatic copying always occurs in this way - i.e. it is never "deep"

// when _s goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function called 'drop' for us, which frees the memory

// If a type has the Copy trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. Rust wonâ€™t let us annotate a type with the Copy trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the Drop trait. 

// Data on the heap will be dropped after it goes out of scope, unless it's moved to another function or piece of code that takes ownership

// it is tedious to always pass ownership around like this though. So it's possible to use a pointer.
