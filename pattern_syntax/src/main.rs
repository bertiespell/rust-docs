Because we’re in a new scope inside the match expression, this is a new y variable, not the y we declared at the beginning with the value 10. This new y binding will match any value inside a Some, which is what we have in x. Therefore, this new y binds to the inner value of the Some in x. That value is 5, so the expression for that arm executes and prints Matched, y = 5.
