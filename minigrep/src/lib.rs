use std::error::Error;
use std::fs;
use std::io::prelude::*; // contains various useful traits for doing I/O, including file I/O.. In the same way that Rust has a general prelude that brings certain types and functions into scope automatically, the std::io module has its own prelude of common types and functions you’ll need when working with I/O. Unlike with the default prelude, we must explicitly add a use statement for the prelude from std::io.


pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> { // Box<dyn Error> means the function will return a type that implements the Error trait, but we don’t have to specify what particular type the return value will be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that may be of different types in different error cases. This is what the dyn means, it's short for "dynamic."
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.filename)?;

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);
    Ok(())

        }
        let query = args[1].clone(); // There’s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using clone to fix ownership problems because of its runtime cost.
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        Ok(Config { query, filename })
    }
}

pub fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
    Config::new(args)
    // (query, filename) // we could put the two values into one struct and give each of the struct fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future maintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each other and what their purpose is.
